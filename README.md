#### Core Technologies:
- **Redis**: Used for caching and managing background job queues.
- **MongoDB**: Provides a NoSQL database for storing user data and file metadata.
- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for building and running the application.

#### Testing and Background Jobs:
- **Background Processing**: Utilize Bull for managing background jobs such as generating image thumbnails and sending welcome messages to new users.
- **Testing**: Employ Mocha and Chai for comprehensive testing of the application's functionality.

This project integrates these technologies to deliver a seamless experience for file management and user interactions.
